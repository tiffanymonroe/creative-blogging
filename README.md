# GA WDI-R Gizmo Project 1
# Creative Blogging

## The Technology
Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS

## The Approach
The school that I teach at likes to use a blogging site, Edublogs, built on Wordpress. My students have struggled with using it, though. There's a lot of confusion between pages and posts, and just too many options for what we need. I decide that I'd build a blogging app that does everything I want it to, but making it super easy for students.

There are three main options: student profiles, a wiki, and the online classroom. The project only focuses on the first two models, both of which are full CRUD. The goal is to have the site fully functional for my spring CW class.

## The Future
-fix sessions
-add categories to the wiki, and individual topic pages
-add the Friday classroom
